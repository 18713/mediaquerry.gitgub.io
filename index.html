                KARACHI: The fate of the remaining <br> matches  of the Pakistan  Super  League <br> (PSL 2021)  in Abu Dhabi is <br> in
                the doldrums  as the organisers are  in <br> a  fix due to operational and  logistical <br> issues.

                The PCB  held an emergency <br> meeting  with the franchise  owners earlier <br> today and shared  the developments <br>
                after it. 

                In a statement issued  after  the <br> meeting,  the PCB  said  the franchises <br> were  updated on the  unanticipated
                <br>  delays  in the  grant of landing <br> permissions  for  chartered flights from <br> India and South Africa.
